# First-Run Setup

Butterclaw includes a small onboarding command:

```cmd
butterclaw --setup
```

You can also run:

```cmd
butterclaw setup
```

The setup flow:

- checks Node.js, Git, and whether Ollama is reachable
- asks which provider to use: `mock`, `ollama`, or `openai-compatible`
- asks for model, workspace, and step limits
- keeps shell access disabled unless you explicitly enable it
- optionally configures Telegram chat access
- creates the config file, memory file, schedule file, agents folder, teams
  folder, sessions folder, and skills folder
- writes a tiny starter skill
- prints the command to run next

After setup, run a quick diagnostic:

```cmd
butterclaw doctor
```

## Suggested Lightweight Setup

For a lightweight local setup, choose:

- provider: `ollama`
- model: `llama3.2:3b` or another compact local model
- shell tool: `no` until you need it

For a hosted API, choose:

- provider: `openai-compatible`
- model: `openai/gpt-oss-120b:free` or the model you want to use

Butterclaw does not issue its own API key. It stores the environment variable
name for your chosen model provider's key, not the secret itself.

## Telegram During Setup

If you choose Telegram setup, Butterclaw stores allowed chat IDs and the token
environment variable name. Set the token before running Telegram:

```cmd
set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:your-token
butterclaw --telegram-poll
```

## Google Workspace

Set Google OAuth client credentials, then login once:

```cmd
set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id
set GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-oauth-client-secret
butterclaw google login
butterclaw "list my calendar events"
```

Use `butterclaw google status` to check the connection and
`butterclaw google logout` to disconnect. Use `--google-calendar-id` to override
the calendar ID.

## Agents, Teams, Sessions, And Skills

After setup, create reusable agent profiles, teams, sessions, and skills:

```cmd
butterclaw agent create debugger --description "Finds bugs" --instructions "Find root causes first."
butterclaw agent create reviewer --description "Reviews code" --instructions "Find bugs, missing tests, and risky behavior first."
butterclaw team create review-crew --agents debugger,reviewer --description "Debug and review together."
butterclaw skill create bug-hunt --description "Use for debugging." --body "Reproduce, inspect logs, run tests, then fix."
```

Run with a saved agent or a named session:

```cmd
butterclaw --agent debugger "inspect this workspace"
butterclaw --session release-work "continue the release checklist"
```

Inspect local state:

```cmd
butterclaw team list
butterclaw session list
butterclaw session show release-work
```

Create a local backup before large changes:

```cmd
butterclaw backup create
```

The backup includes agents, teams, skills, sessions, schedules, and memory.
OAuth token state and usage files are excluded.

## Local Schedules

Butterclaw can store one-shot reminders and recurring jobs in the config folder:

```cmd
butterclaw schedule add --name check-in --at 20m --message "remind me to review the build"
butterclaw schedule add --name morning-brief --every 1d --message "summarize this workspace"
butterclaw schedule run --due
```

See [SCHEDULING.md](SCHEDULING.md) for the command surface.

## Gateway Hooks

For local automation hooks, set a token and start the gateway:

```cmd
set BUTTERCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=choose-a-local-token
butterclaw gateway serve
```

Use `butterclaw gateway status` or `/gateway` to inspect the configured host,
port, hook path, and token environment variable. See [GATEWAY.md](GATEWAY.md).
